# Review

- .smallest[.pink[Statistical inference] allows to infer the properties of a population based on an observed sample.]
- .smallest[For example, .pink[proportion estimation]] `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{p}}\)` .smallest[is .purple[random] as it is sample dependent. Therefore, we need to assess the .purple[uncertainty] of] `\(\hat{p}\)` .smallest[to infer on] `\(p\)`.
- .smallest[One common approach to measure uncertainty is to use .pink[confidence intervals], which rely on .pink[Central Limit Theorem]. In the case of proportion estimation, we have] `$$\small \hat{p} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} \mathcal{N}\Bigg(\color{#e64173}{p}, \color{#6A5ACD}{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\Bigg).$$`
- .smallest[Confidence intervals correspond to a range of values that include the population value with .purple[a certain level of confidence]. The] `\(1-\alpha\)` .smallest[confidence interval for] `\(p\)` .smallest[is given by] `\(\color{#e64173}{\hat{p}} \pm Z_{1-\alpha/2}\color{#6A5ACD}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}}\)` .smallest[, and obviously, it is random.]
- .smallest[In Statistics, a decision or prediction can never be made with certainty. There always exists .purple[a trade-off between the risk and the precision of the conclusion], and how much risk is acceptable depends on the context.]

# How to test a (scientific) hypothesis?

]

- .smallest[To assess the .pink[validity of a (scientific) hypothesis], the scientific community generally agrees on .purple[a specific procedure].]
- .smallest[These hypotheses can be .pink[nearly anything], such as:]
  1. .smallest[Coffee consumption increases blood pressure. ‚òïÔ∏è]
  2. .smallest[Republican politicians are bad/good for the American Economy. ]
  3. .smallest[A glass of red wine is as good as an hour at the gym. üç∑üèãÔ∏è]
- .smallest[This procedure involves the design of an experiment and then the collection of data to compute a metric (called p-value) which .purple[evaluates the adequacy between the data and your original hypothesis.]]
- .smallest[There is generally .pink[a specific threshold] (typically 5%), and if the p-value falls below this threshold .purple[we can claim that we have statistically significant result(s) validating our hypothesis.]]

.footnote[.smallest[üëã From W. Edwards Deming]]

# Statistics vs Truth

- .smallest[.pink[Statistically significant results are not necessarily the truth], as there isn't a threshold (again typically 5%) that separates real results from the false ones.]
- .smallest[This procedure simply provides us with one piece of a puzzle that should be considered in the context of other evidence.]

&lt;img src="pics/medical_studies2.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] Read the original article: "*This is why you shouldn't believe that exciting new medical study*" [here](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/23/8264355/research-study-hype).]

# A hypothesis testing

- In the Biden-Trump example, recall that we want to verify if Biden will win the popular vote. Then we can translate this into the following hypotheses:
.center[
`\(H_0: p = 0.5\)` and `\(H_a: p &gt; 0.5\)`.
]
- In a hypothesis test, the statement being tested is called the .hi-pink[null hypothesis] `\(\color{#e64173}{H_0}\)`. A hypothesis test is designed to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.
- The .hi-pink[alternative hypothesis] `\(\color{#e64173}{H_a}\)` is the statement we hope or suspect to be true instead of `\(H_0\)`.
- Each hypothesis .purple[excludes the other], so that one can .purple[exclude one in favor of the other] using the data.

# A hypothesis testing

|                     | `\(H_0\)` is true                               | `\(H_0\)` is false                          |
| ------------------- |---------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------|
| Can't reject `\(H_0\)`  | `\(\text{Correct decision (prob=}1-\alpha)\)`   | `\(\text{Type II error (prob=}1-\beta)\)`   |
| Reject `\(H_0\)`        | `\(\text{Type I error (prob=}\alpha)\)`         | `\(\text{Correct decision (prob=}\beta)\)`  |

- If we reject `\(H_0\)` when in fact `\(H_0\)` is true, this is a .pink[type I error] (also called .pink[false positive]). If we accept `\(H_0\)` when in fact `\(H_a\)` is true, this is a .purple[type II error] (also called .purple[false negative]).
- A test is of .pink[significance level] `\(\color{#e64173}{\alpha}\)` when the probability to make a type I error is `\(\alpha\)`. Usually we consider `\(\alpha = 5\%\)`, however, this can vary depending on the context.
- A test is of .purple[power] `\(\color{#6A5ACD}{\beta}\)` when the probability to make a type II error is `\(1-\beta.\)` In other words, the power of a test is its probability to reject `\(H_0\)` when `\(H_0\)` is false.

# Test statistics and P-values

- .smallest[A hypothesis testing is based on a .hi-pink[test statistic], which measures the difference between the sample estimate and the hypothesized value in terms of its standard deviation, i.e.] 
`$$\small \text{test statistic} = \frac{\text{sample estimate - hypothesized value}}{\text{standard deviation of sample estimate}}.$$`

- .smallest[For example, consider a test for a single proportion with] `\(\small H_0: p = p_0\)` .smallest[and] `\(\small H_a: p &gt; p_0\)`.smallest[, the corresponding test statistic can be computed as] `$$Z = \frac{\hat{p}-\color{#e64173}{p_0}}{\color{#6A5ACD}{\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1).$$`
- .smallest[The .hi-purple[p-value] is defined as the probability, assuming that] `\(\small H_0\)` .smallest[is true, that the test statistic will take a value at least as extreme as that actually observed.] ü§Øüò±
- .smallest[Informally, .pink[a p-value can be understood as a measure of plausibility of the null hypothesis given the data]. Small p-value indicates strong evidence against] `\(\small H_0\)`.

---

# How to understand p-values?

- When the p-value is small enough (i.e. smaller than the significance level `\(\alpha\)`), one says that the test based on the null and alternative hypotheses is .pink[significant] or that the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative. .purple[This is generally what we want because it "verifies" our (research) hypothesis].
- When the p-value is not small enough, with the available data, we cannot reject the null hypothesis so .pink[nothing] can be concluded. ü§î
- With a sample of data, the obtained p-value summarizes somehow the .pink[incompatibility between the data and the model] (random process) constructed under the set of assumptions.

# The one-sample Student's t-test

- .smallest[So far we discuss about significance test for a single proportion. How can we perform a .purple[test for the mean of a population]? We will use .hi-pink[the Student's t-test] (or simply t-test) &lt;sup&gt;.smallest[üëã]&lt;/sup&gt;, in which the test statistic follows a .pink[Student's t distribution] under the null hypothesis.] 

- .smallest[The Student's t distributions were discovered in 1908 by William S. Gosset, who is a statistician employed by the Guinness brewing company. Gosset devised the t-test as an economical way to monitor the quality of stout. At that time, the company forbade its scientists from publishing their findings, so Gosset published his statistical work under the pen name "Student" in the journal Biometrika. So the Student's t-test is named after Gosset's contributions. üçªü§ì]

- .smallest[A t-test is useful to test if the population mean is .pink[greater, smaller, or different than] a hypothesized value.]

.footnote[.smallest[üëã The Student's t-test is used when the population variance is unknown. In some uncommon cases where the population variance is known, we use the Z-test, where the test statistic follows a standard normal distribution. Check out more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test).]]

# Data visualization

- .smallest[Before assessing if the mean of a population fits our hypothesis, we generally .purple[start by presenting our data visually].]

# Summary

- .pink[In general, assessing whether the data is normally distributed is very difficult.] In fact, there is no satisfactory statistical method for it.
- In practice, we recommend to always first look at the boxplot, assess the symmetry of the data and verify that there is no outlier (or data that is too far from the bulk of the data). If these conditions do not appear to be satisfied, it is preferable to use the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. 
- .purple[Our recommendation is to always use the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test], as it is generally challenging to assess if the assumptions are satisfied for a t-test, and if the data actually satisfy the normality condition. We may lose a bit of power using the Wilcoxon signed rank test compared to the t-test if all the conditions are indeed satisfied, however, the difference is generally very small.

- .smallest[.purple[It tests each individual hypothesis at a reduced significance level.] For example, if a trial is testing 20 hypotheses with a desired] `\(\small \alpha = 5\%\)`.smallest[, then the Bonferroni correction would test each individual hypothesis at] `\(\small \alpha^* = \alpha/20 = 5\% / 20 = 0.25\%\)`.smallest[. Therefore, .purple[it controls the familywise error rate at]] `\(\small \color{#6A5ACD}{\leq \alpha}\)`.
- .smallest[The Bonferroni correction can be .turquoise[conservative] if there are a large number of tests, as it comes at the cost of reducing the power of the tests.]
- .smallest[Another more recent and less conservative method is the .hi-pink[False Discovery Rate (FDR)]. It provides less stringent control of Type I errors compared to the Bonferroni correction. Thus, the FDR has greater power, yet at the cost of increased numbers of Type I errors.]

# The one-way ANOVA

- .smallest[To compare several means of different populations, a standard approach is to start our analysis by using the .hi-pink[(one-way) ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA)] &lt;sup&gt;.smallest[üëã]&lt;/sup&gt;. More precisely, we proceed our analysis with the following steps:]
  - .smallest[.purple[Step 1:] We first perform the ANOVA, where the null hypothesis states that all the means are the same. If we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we stop our analysis here. Otherwise, we move on to Step 2.]
  - .smallest[.purple[Step 2:] We compare the groups mutually with two-sample t-tests in order to verify our hypothesis.]
- .smallest[For example, suppose we have 3 groups and our hypothesis is that the mean of Group 1 is larger than the mean of Group 2, which is larger than the mean of Group 3. We start with an ANOVA and test if all the means are equal. If we reject the null hypothesis, then we perform the two-sample t tests of Group 1 vs Group 2, Group 1 vs Group 3, and Group 2 vs Group 3, which in total are 3 tests.]

# The one-way ANOVA

.smallest[The one-way ANOVA makes similar assumptions as the two-sample t-test:]

- .smallest[The] `\(\small j^{th}\)` .smallest[population has a .pink[normal distribution] with unknown mean] `\(\small \mu_j\)`.
- .smallest[.purple[All the populations have the same variance], whose value is unknown.]

.smallest[Then the hypotheses for the one-way ANOVA can be specified as follows:]
`\begin{align}
&amp; \small H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \ldots = \mu_J \\
&amp; \small H_a: H_0 \text{ is false}
\end{align}`

.smallest[‚ö†Ô∏è Notice that the alternative says that the null hypothesis is false, which can be true because all the means are different or simply because one of them differs from the rest. So this is a more complex situation than comparing just two populations. .pink[If we reject the null hypothesis, we need to perform some further analysis to draw conclusions about which population means differ from which others and by how much.]]

She wants to show that more weed lead to less corn yields with the following data:]
`\begin{align}

# Kruskal-Wallis test

- .smallest[The .hi-pink[Kruskal-Wallis test] is a test that can replace the ANOVA F-test. The assumption about data production (i.e. independent random samples from each population) remains important, but .pink[we can relax the normality and the same variance assumptions.] Indeed, we only need to assume that the response has a continuous distribution in each population.]
- .smallest[Just like the Wilcoxon tests for one and two samples, .purple[the Kruskal-Wallis test is particularly useful when there are outliers and/or when the normality condition cannot be satisfied.]]
- .smallest[The idea of the Kruskal-Wallis test is to rank all the responses from all groups together and then apply the one-way ANOVA to the .turquoise[ranks] rather than to the original observations. Therefore, it is a .turquoise[nonparametric test].]
- .smallest[In the simplest form, the Kruskal-Wallis test states the hypotheses in terms of .pink[population median]. That is,]
`\begin{align}
&amp; \small H_0: \text{all populations have the same median} \\
&amp; \small H_a: H_0 \text{ is false}
