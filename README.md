Welcome to the course on **Introduction to Statistics** taught by
[Stéphane Guerrier](https://stephaneguerrier.com/) and [Yuming
Zhang](https://github.com/Yuming-Zhang).

# Course material

The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly
if you are connected to the internet. If you’re going off grid, grab the
PDFs. You’ll miss out on gifs and videos, but the rest will actually
show up.

*Note:* The slides were created with
[`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in
[R](cran.r-project.org) and the
[template](https://github.com/edrubin/EC607S20) is based on the work of
Dr. [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in)
