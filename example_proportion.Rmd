# Population and Sample - Example

.smallest[To fix ideas we will consider a simple example. The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on November 3, 2020. According to the latest estimates the .hi.pink[Biden's team received 51.3% of the votes while Trumps' received 46.8%] <sup>.smallest[üëã]</sup>. Naturally, the result of American elections are determined by the popular vote but suppose that we were interested in collecting data .hi-purple[before the vote] to assess if Biden's team will receive more than 50% of the votes].

# Population and Sample - Example

.pull-left[.smaller[In this example, we will make the .purple[following assumptions for simplicity]:

- The American population of voters is composed of 1200 individuals (616 for Biden, 561 for Trump and 23 independents).
- We can perfectly sample the population (everyone is available, no double sampling, and the sampling is random).
- People don't change their mind and they don't lie.

# Proportion Estimation

Suppose we ask  $n$ voters for which candidate (Biden, Trump or independent) they intend to vote in order to estimate the proportion of voters for Biden. For that we define the .hi.purple[random variables] $X_1, ..., X_n$ where $X_i$ is defined as:

.smaller[
.center[
`\(
X_i = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1  & \mbox{if voter } i \mbox{ intends to vote for Biden}\\
		0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
	\end{array}
\right.
\)`
]
]


The random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$ are called a (random) .hi.purple[sample] and we refer to $n$ as the .hi.purple[sample size]. We let $p$ denote the (true) proportion of voters for Biden (which in this case is 51.3%). Then, we have


$$
\begin{align}
\color{#e64173}{\Pr \Big(} {X_i = 1} \color{#e64173}{\Big)} = p,
\end{align}
$$


where $\color{#e64173}{\Pr (} A \color{#e64173}{)}$ denote the .pink[probability] of the event $A$.

# Proportion Estimation

Using the random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$ we can define an .hi.purple[estimator] of $p$, which we often write as $\hat{p}$:


$$\hat{p} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \frac{\color{#e64173}{m}}{\color{#6A5ACD}{n}},$$


where $\color{#e64173}{m}$ and $\color{#6A5ACD}{n}$ denote, respectively, the number of voters in our sample in favor of Biden and the sample size.

In theory, any function of the data (i.e. $X_1, ..., X_n$) can be (at least in principle) an estimator. However, in this case $\hat{p}$ is the best possible estimator of $p$ <sup>.smallest[üëã]</sup> and it is not useful (in this case) to search for better estimators.

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] More precisely, this estimator is unbiased [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator) and has the smallest possible variance [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) as it attains the Cram√©r‚ÄìRao bound [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound).]

# Population and Sample - Example

.pull-left[
.smallest[
Consider a sample of $n = 10$ voters (randomly chosen in the population) a shown here üëâ. In this case, we have 5 voters for Biden and 5 for Trump. We say that $x_1 = 1, ..., x_5 = 1, x_6 = 0, ..., x_{10}$ are .hi.purple[realizations] of the random variables $X_1, ..., X_{10}$.

We can now compute our estimator on the observed data (i.e. the realizations) and we obtain $\hat{p} = 0.5$. Therefore, .purple[our best guess] based on the available data is that 50% of the voters will vote for Biden. Unfortunately, this doesn't really help us. Let us try with a bigger sample size... say $n = 40$.

# Should we measure uncertainty?

(mingming: to improve)

- In our example, we are interested in knowing if $p$ is bigger or smaller than 50% but, unfortunately, $p$ is unknown (in general) and we use $\hat{p}$ instead.
- Our estimator $\hat{p}$ is not perfect and it is different from $p$. Also, we see that depending on $n$ we can get different answers (see $n = 200$ and $n = 600$).
- To address this issue we can try to assess the uncertainty of $\hat{p}$ (i.e. assess how different $\hat{p}$ and $p$ can be).
- .pink[Uncertainty can be measured in many different ways]. A common approach (in statistics) is to use .hi-purple[confidence intervals]. 
- In order to understand how such intervals can obtained, we will first present the .hi.purple[Central Limit Theorem], which states that: .turquoise[the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger]. So, what does this means? üòü
