# How can statistics be useful?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

As mentioned previously, statistics is the .pink[science of learning from data]. It can be used (among others) to:
1. .purple[Visualize data] (e.g. propagation of COVID-19 in different countries).
2. .purple[Understand and interpret data] (e.g. main causes of cancer). 
3. .purple[Make predictions] (e.g. predicting unemployment or risk indices).
4. .hi-pink[Assess the validity of a hypothesis].

In this class, we will focus on the last point:
''.pink[*how to assess the validity of a hypothesis using statistics?*]''. More precisely, we will discuss how statistical methods can be used to evaluate claims (hypotheses) such as:

1. Coffee consumption increases blood pressure (really üôÑ ‚òï?).
2. Republican politicians are bad/good for the American Economy.
3. A glass of red wine is as good as an hour at the gym (üç∑ üèÉ üòÜ).

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistical methods are based on several fundamental concepts, the most central of which is to consider the information available (in the form of data) resulting from a .hi-pink[random process]. üôâ
- As such, the data represent a .hi-turquoise[random sample] of a totally or conceptually accessible .hi-turquoise[population].

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistics allows to determine the .hi-pink[decision-making risks] (in the form of probabilities) associated with learning (decisions) based on the analysis of data extracted from samples. .slate[This allows to evaluate the validity of a claim] (such as the ones we discussed previously). 
- .purple[Understanding and knowing how to interpret statistical analyses is therefore becoming an increasingly vital skill].
- In some sense, .hi-pink[statistics plays a crucial role in our life] as new discoveries (obtained using statistical methods) directly impact us&lt;sup&gt;.smallest[üëã]&lt;/sup&gt;.
- However, understanding statistical results is not intuitive. There exist many pitfalls such as .purple[p-hacking] or .purple[HARKing] (e.g. why are there so many contradictory studies? Is Hydroxychloroquine working or not?).

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] This  is essentially true in the area of .hi-purple[Big Data] where the discovery of patterns and/or signals hidden in massive amounts of data is increasingly becoming one of the major challenges faced by modern scientific research.]

# Population and Sample - Example

To fix ideas we will consider a simple example. On September 27 2020, the Swiss population voted on the .pink[*Loi f√©d√©rale sur la chasse et la protection des mammif√®res et oiseaux sauvages (Loi sur la chasse, LChP)*]. The proposal was not accepted as it only received 48% of supporting votes&lt;sup&gt;.smallest[üëã]&lt;/sup&gt;. Suppose that we were interested in collecting data .hi-purple[before the vote] to assess if this proposal was likely to be accepted. In this example, we will make the following assumptions for simplicity:

- The Swiss population of voters is composed of 1200 individuals (576 for the project, 624 against).
- We can perfectly sample the population (everyone is available, no double sampling, and the sampling is random).
- People don't change their mind and they don't lie.

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] More details on the results can be found [here](https://www.bk.admin.ch/ch/f/pore/va/20200927/index.html).]

# How to measure uncertainty?

- .smaller[.pink[Uncertainty can be measured in many different ways]].
- .smaller[A common approach (in statistics) is to use .hi-purple[confidence intervals]]. 
- .smaller[These intervals correspond to .pink[a range of values that are likely to include the population value with a certain level of confidence]. The level of confidence is a probability expressed as a percentage (%).] 
- .smaller[In our example, we are interested in the true (population) proportion of voters in favor of the proposal (48%). Using our second sample (8 against and 12 for) we could construct the following 90% confidence interval]:

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="pics/CI.jpeg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.smaller[.pull-right[
So what does it mean? ü§î It means that with a .hi-purple[probability of 90%] the true proportion of voters for the project (48% in this case) is between say 40% and 80%.]

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Take home message

- Since the data is available through sampling, it is .hi-purple[random]. .pink[Therefore, a decision or prediction can never be made with certainty!]
- The only certainty one can have is that, for example, a proportion will always be included in the interval from 0% to 100%. .hi-purple[However, this is neither informative nor useful] üßê and it does not even depend on the data.
- There exists a trade-off between .hi-pink[risk] as measured by  1 - `\(\alpha\)` (typically 95%) the confidence level, and the .hi-pink[precision of the conclusion] as measured, for example, by the confidence interval length.
- Moreover, the larger the sample size, the more precise the conclusion, for the same confidence level.
- Therefore, .purple[every decision based on statistical methods has a risk and how much risk is acceptable depends on the context] (e.g. safety in airplanes vs which soft drink tastes better).
