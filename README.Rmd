# Course materials

The linked slides (below) are `.html` files that will only work properly if you are connected to the internet. If you're going off grid, grab the PDFs. You'll miss out on gifs and videos, but the rest will still show up.

*Note:* The slides were created with [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki) in [R](cran.r-project.org) and the [template](https://github.com/edrubin/EC607S20) is based on the work of [Ed Rubin](https://edrub.in)
