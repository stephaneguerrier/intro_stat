# Introduction

Welcome to the class "Introduction to Statistics"! We hope that you all will enjoy this class!

Throughout this class, we will use a platform called .hi-pink[Piazza] for the share of all the teaching materials and Q&A. 

```{R, out.width = "40%", echo = F}
include_graphics("pics/piazza.png")
```

- Signup Link: [https://piazza.com/configure-classes/winter2020/sisu](https://piazza.com/configure-classes/winter2020/sisu)
- Access Code: .purple[statisfun]

# Introduction 

In this class, we will also use some statistical softwares .hi-pink[R] and .hi-pink[R Studio], which you can download with the following: 

- Latest version of R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- Latest version of R Studio: [https://www.rstudio.com/](https://www.rstudio.com/)

.hi-purple[Note:] You cannot use RStudio without having installed R on your computer.

# What is statistics?

.pull-left[
.smaller[.hi-pink[Statistics] is a science that uses mathematics and computer science to deal with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data. Informally, it is the .pink[science of learning from data].]
```{R, stat, out.width = "90%", echo = F}

```

]

.pull-right[
.smaller[.hi-purple[Statistics] is a crucial part of our life. However, .purple[statistical methods are often consciously (or not) misused]. This can lead to contradictory studies and conclusions (as seen during the current COVID-19 pandemic).]

# How can statistics be useful?

As mentioned previously, statistics is the .pink[science of learning from data]. It can be used (among others) to

1. .purple[Visualize data] (e.g. propagation of COVID-19 in different countries).
2. .purple[Understand and interpret data] (e.g. main causes of cancer). 
3. .purple[Assess the validity of a hypothesis].
4. .purple[Make predictions] (e.g. predicting unemployment or risk indices).

Learning statistics allows us to 

1. .smallest[.pink[Understand data], or arguments that use data.]
2. .smallest[Be able to apply .pink[critical thinking] about numbers and about .pink[statistics used as evidence in arguments].]
3. .smallest[Understand how statistical associations are used to .pink[evaluate claims (hypotheses)] and .pink[assess causal connections.] (e.g. Coffee consumption increases blood pressure? üßê)]

# Simpson's Paradox

.pull-left[.smallest[.pink[Statistical analysis can be tricky.] Here we give an example of a study of gender bias among graduate school admissions to University of California, Berkeley, for the fall of 1973.]

```{R, out.width = "100%", echo = F}
include_graphics("pics/berkeley1.png")
```

```{R, out.width = "100%", echo = F}
include_graphics("pics/berkeley2.png")
```

]

.pull-right[

1. .smallest[The table of total admission shows that men applying were more likely than women to be admitted, and the difference was so large (9%) that it was unlikely to be due to chance.]
2. .smallest[However, when we look into the admission data by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants.]
3. .smallest[This phenomenon is known as .hi-purple[Simpson's Paradox]. ]

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistical methods are based on several fundamental concepts, the most central of which is to consider the information available (in the form of data) resulting from a .hi-pink[random process]. üôâ
- As such, the data represent a .hi-turquoise[random sample] of a totally or conceptually accessible .hi-turquoise[population].

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistics allows to determine the .hi-pink[decision-making risks] (in the form of probabilities) associated with learning (decisions) based on the analysis of data extracted from samples. .slate[This allows to evaluate the validity of a claim] (such as the ones we discussed previously). 
- .purple[Understanding and knowing how to interpret statistical analyses is therefore becoming an increasingly vital skill].
- In some sense, .hi-pink[statistics plays a crucial role in our life] as new discoveries (obtained using statistical methods) directly impact us<sup>.smallest[üëã]</sup>.
- However, understanding statistical results is not intuitive. There exist many pitfalls such as .purple[p-hacking] or .purple[HARKing] (e.g. why are there so many contradictory studies? Is Hydroxychloroquine working or not?).

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] This  is essentially true in the area of .hi-purple[Big Data] where the discovery of patterns and/or signals hidden in massive amounts of data is increasingly becoming one of the major challenges faced by modern scientific research.]
