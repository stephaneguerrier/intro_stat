# How can statistics be useful?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

As mentioned previously, statistics is the .pink[science of learning from data]. It can be used (among others) to:
1. .purple[Visualize data] (e.g. propagation of COVID-19 in different countries).
2. .purple[Understand and interpret data] (e.g. main causes of cancer). 
3. .purple[Make predictions] (e.g. predicting unemployment or risk indices).
4. .hi-pink[Assess the validity of a hypothesis].

In this class, we will focus on the last point:
''.pink[*how to assess the validity of a hypothesis using statistics?*]''. More precisely, we will discuss how statistical methods can be used to evaluate claims (hypotheses) such as:

1. Coffee consumption increases blood pressure (really üôÑ ‚òï?).
2. Republican politicians are bad/good for the American Economy.
3. A glass of red wine is as good as an hour at the gym (üç∑ üèÉ üòÜ).

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistical methods are based on several fundamental concepts, the most central of which is to consider the information available (in the form of data) resulting from a .hi-pink[random process]. üôâ
- As such, the data represent a .hi-turquoise[random sample] of a totally or conceptually accessible .hi-turquoise[population].

# How does it work?

(MAYBE KEEP THIS SLIDE BUT ADAPT)

- Statistics allows to determine the .hi-pink[decision-making risks] (in the form of probabilities) associated with learning (decisions) based on the analysis of data extracted from samples. .slate[This allows to evaluate the validity of a claim] (such as the ones we discussed previously). 
- .purple[Understanding and knowing how to interpret statistical analyses is therefore becoming an increasingly vital skill].
- In some sense, .hi-pink[statistics plays a crucial role in our life] as new discoveries (obtained using statistical methods) directly impact us<sup>.smallest[üëã]</sup>.
- However, understanding statistical results is not intuitive. There exist many pitfalls such as .purple[p-hacking] or .purple[HARKing] (e.g. why are there so many contradictory studies? Is Hydroxychloroquine working or not?).

.footnote[.smallest[üëã] This  is essentially true in the area of .hi-purple[Big Data] where the discovery of patterns and/or signals hidden in massive amounts of data is increasingly becoming one of the major challenges faced by modern scientific research.]
