# How can statistics be useful?

.smallest[As mentioned previously, statistics is the .pink[science of learning from data]. It can be used (among others) to

1. .purple[Visualize data] (e.g. propagation of COVID-19 in different countries).
2. .purple[Understand and interpret data] (e.g. main causes of cancer). 
3. .purple[Assess the validity of a hypothesis].
4. .purple[Make predictions] (e.g. predicting unemployment or risk indices).]

.smallest[Learning statistics allows us to ]

1. .smallest[.pink[Understand data], or arguments that use data.]
2. .smallest[Be able to apply .pink[critical thinking] about numbers and about .pink[statistics used as evidence in arguments].]
3. .smallest[Understand how statistical associations are used to .pink[evaluate claims (hypotheses)] and .pink[assess causal connections.] (e.g. Coffee consumption increases blood pressure?)]  

.smallest[.purple[To summarize, understanding and knowing how to interpret statistical analyses is therefore becoming an increasingly vital skill.]]

# How does it work?

.smallest[
- Statistical methods are based on several fundamental concepts, the most central of which is to consider the information available (in the form of data) resulting from a .hi-pink[random process]. ðŸ™‰
- As such, the data represent a .hi-turquoise[random sample] of a totally or conceptually accessible .hi-turquoise[population].
- We can then provide .hi-purple[statistical inference] which infers properties of a population based on the observed sample. This includes deriving estimates and testing hypotheses.
- However, understanding statistical results is not intuitive. There exist many pitfalls such as .purple[p-hacking] or .purple[HARKing]. ]

# How does it work?

(TO REMOVE)

- Statistics allows to determine the .hi-pink[decision-making risks] (in the form of probabilities) associated with learning (decisions) based on the analysis of data extracted from samples. .slate[This allows to evaluate the validity of a claim] (such as the ones we discussed previously). 
- .purple[Understanding and knowing how to interpret statistical analyses is therefore becoming an increasingly vital skill].
- In some sense, .hi-pink[statistics plays a crucial role in our life] as new discoveries (obtained using statistical methods) directly impact us<sup>.smallest[ðŸ‘‹]</sup>.
- However, understanding statistical results is not intuitive. There exist many pitfalls such as .purple[p-hacking] or .purple[HARKing] (e.g. why are there so many contradictory studies? Is Hydroxychloroquine working or not?).

.footnote[.smallest[ðŸ‘‹] This is essentially true in the area of .hi-purple[Big Data] where the discovery of patterns and/or signals hidden in massive amounts of data is increasingly becoming one of the major challenges faced by modern scientific research.]

# Outline

In this class, we plan to cover the following topics: 

- Introduction to .pink[statistical inference] (concepts of random variables, confidence interval and p-values).
- Introduction to the .purple[statistical software R].
- .pink[Tests for comparing the mean of two groups] (descriptive analysis, t-test, rank-based methods).
- .purple[Tests for comparing the mean of multiple groups] (descriptive analysis, ANOVA and non-parametric counterpart, discussion on multiple testing).
- Introduction to .pink[regression] (correlation vs causality, descriptive analysis, linear regression and going beyond linear regression).
- .purple[Pitfalls] for statistical analysis and remedies (p-hacking/HARKing and how to avoid it, replicability crisis).

# Population and Sample - Example

.smallest[To fix ideas we will consider a simple example. The 2020 United States presidential election was the 59th quadrennial presidential election, held on November 3, 2020. According to the latest estimates, .hi.pink[Biden's team received 51.3% of the votes while Trump's received 46.8%] <sup>.smallest[ðŸ‘‹]</sup>. Naturally, the result of American elections is not determined by the popular vote but suppose that we were interested in collecting data .hi-purple[before the vote] to assess if Biden's team will receive more than 50% of the votes].

# Population and Sample - Example

.pull-left[.smaller[In this example, we will make the .purple[following assumptions for simplicity]:

- The American population of voters is composed of 1200 individuals (616 for Biden, 561 for Trump and 23 independents).
- We can perfectly sample the population (everyone is available, no double sampling, and the sampling is random).
- People don't change their mind and they don't lie.

# Proportion Estimation

Suppose we ask $n$ voters for which candidate (Biden, Trump or independent) they intend to vote in order to estimate the proportion of voters for Biden. For tWine the .hi.purple[random variables] $X_1, ..., X_n$ where $X_i$ is defined as:

.saller[
.center[
`\(
X_i = \left\{
	\begin{array}{ll}
		1  & \mbox{if voter } i \mbox{ intends to vote for Biden}\\
		0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
	\end{array}
\right.
\)`
]
]


The random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$ are called a (random) .hi.purple[sample] and we refer to $n$ as the .hi.purple[sample size]. Let denote the (true) proportion of voters for Biden (which in this case is 51.3%), we then write


$$
\begin{align}
\color{#e64173}{\Pr \Big(} {X_i = 1} \color{#e64173}{\Big)} = p,
\end{align}
$$


where $\color{#e64173}{\Pr (} A \color{#e64173}{)}$ denote the .pink[probability] of the .purple[event] $A$.

---

# Proportion Estimation

Using the random variables $X_1, ..., X_n$ we can define an .hi.purple[estimator] of $p$, which we often write as $\hat{p}$ and is given by


$$\hat{p} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \frac{\color{#e64173}{m}}{\color{#6A5ACD}{n}},$$


where $\color{#e64173}{m}$ denotes the number of voters in our sample in favor of Biden, and $\color{#6A5ACD}{n}$ is the sample size (as described previously).

An estimator is defined as a function of the data (i.e. $X_1, ..., X_n$), and therefore, theoretically any function of $X_1, ..., X_n$ can be an estimator. However, in this case $\hat{p}$ is the best possible estimator of $p$ <sup>.smallest[ðŸ‘‹]</sup> and therefore it is not useful (in this case) to search for better estimators.

.footnote[.smallest[ðŸ‘‹] More precisely, this estimator is unbiased [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator) and has the smallest possible variance [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) as it attains the CramÃ©râ€“Rao bound [(more info.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cram%C3%A9r%E2%80%93Rao_bound).]

# Population and Sample - Example

.pull-left[
.smallest[
Consider a sample of $n = 10$ voters (randomly chosen from the population) as shown here ðŸ‘‰. In this case, we have 5 voters for Biden and 5 for Trump. We say that $$x_1 = 1, ..., x_5 = 1, x_6 = 0, ..., x_{10} = 0$$ are .hi.purple[realizations] of the random variables $X_1, ..., X_{10}$.

We can now compute our estimator on the observed data (i.e. the realizations) and we obtain $\hat{p} = 0.5$. Therefore, .pink[our best guess] based on the available data is that 50% of the voters will vote for Biden. Unfortunately, this doesn't really help us. So let's try with a bigger sample size... say $n = 40$.

# Population and Sample - Example

- In our example, we are interested in knowing if $p$, a .pink[population-level quantity] is bigger or smaller than 50%. Unfortunately, $p$ is generally unknown as we cannot access the whole population. Therefore, we use $\hat{p}$ instead, a .purple[sample-dependent quantity].
- However, as we can see, $\hat{p}$ is .hi.turquoise[random] in the sense that it can change depending on the collected sample (e.g. we get different answers when $n = 200$ and when $n = 600$). 
- To address this issue, we need to assess the .hi.pink[uncertainty] of $\hat{p}$ (i.e. assess how different $\hat{p}$ and $p$ can be).

---

# How to measure uncertainty?

.pink[Uncertainty can be measured in many different ways]. A common approach (in statistics) is to use .hi-purple[confidence intervals], which rely on the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) that states:

.center[.turquoise["The sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches to a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger."]]

Loosely speaking, we can translate the CLT as $$\bar{X} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^2),$$ with some $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$<sup>.smallest[ðŸ‘‹]</sup>. Here $\bar{X}$ denotes the sample mean and $\overset{\cdot}{\sim}$ represents "approximately distributed as". In our example, we have $$\hat{p} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N(p, \frac{p(1-p)}{n})$$. 

.footnote[.smallest[ðŸ‘‹] More precisely, $\mu$ is the expected value (also called expectation) of $\hat{p}$ and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of $\hat{p}$. Check out [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) and [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance).]

# Should we measure uncertainty?

(mingming: to improve)

- In our example, we are interested in knowing if $p$ is bigger or smaller than 50% but, unfortunately, $p$ is unknown (in general) and we use $\hat{p}$ instead.
- Our estimator $\hat{p}$ is not perfect and it is different from $p$. Also, we see that depending on $n$ we can get different answers (see $n = 200$ and $n = 600$).
- To address this issue we can try to assess the uncertainty of $\hat{p}$ (i.e. assess how different $\hat{p}$ and $p$ can be).
- .pink[Uncertainty can be measured in many different ways]. A common approach (in statistics) is to use .hi-purple[confidence intervals]. 
- In order to understand how such intervals can obtained, we will first present the .hi.purple[Central Limit Theorem], which states that: .turquoise[the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger]. So, what does this means? ðŸ˜Ÿ
